## 🚨 Ambulance Siren Detection System for Automated Traffic Control 🚦

Empowering emergency response with smart traffic management! This system uses audio classification to detect ambulance sirens in real-time, automatically adjusting traffic lights to prioritize emergency vehicles. Here's what makes our project unique:

### 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects ambulance sirens using advanced audio classification algorithms.
- **Automated Traffic Control**: Instantly switches traffic lights to green for ambulances, clearing the way for faster emergency response.
- **AI-Powered Audio Recognition**: Utilizes machine learning models to accurately differentiate ambulance sirens from other urban noises.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed to integrate easily with existing traffic control systems for a smart city setup.

### 🚀 How It Works
1. **Audio Data Collection** 🎙️: Records ambient sounds using microphones placed at intersections.
2. **Siren Detection** 📡: Applies machine learning algorithms to classify the sound, identifying if it's an ambulance siren.
3. **Automated Signal Control** 🚦: If an ambulance is detected, traffic lights change to green to prioritize its passage.
4. **Real-Time Response** ⏱️: Immediate adjustments to traffic signals to minimize delays for emergency vehicles.

### 🎯 Our Goal
To enhance emergency response times by providing a reliable, automated system that optimizes traffic flow for ambulances. This project aims to improve safety and efficiency at traffic intersections, ensuring that emergency vehicles reach their destination without delay.

### 💡 Technologies Used
- **Audio Classification** 🧠: Leveraging deep learning for accurate sound recognition.
- **Signal Control** 🔄: Integrating with traffic light systems for automated response.
- **Noise Filtering Algorithms** 🎚️: Designed to identify sirens amidst city noise for reliable detection.
